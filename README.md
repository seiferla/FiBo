## Introduction

We are a group of five CS students from DHBW Karlsruhe working on the project FiBo with the goal to get a better overview of your financial expenses. 
Our project FiBo has nothing to do with the fitness fair, but is the abbreviation for **financial book**.

## Product vision
We want to build an app for managing your finances. An app to track and decrease your expenses easily, an app to plan your financial future.
You will be able to scan all your receipts, with your phone and FiBo will do the rest for you. It automatically categorizes your expenses and tells you how much money you have left for the month.<br>
FiBo also integrates you bank account, so that you can directly see your balance, without changing the app. You want to save money for a big investment, no problem FiBo got your back, it tells you how long it will probably take you to reach your goal.
FiBo is the all-in-one app for managing your finances.<br>
And we want to build it!
