# FiBo Android app

## Setting up development environment

Please set the following to the `local.properties` (SDK Location) file:

```ini
jwsSigningKey="<replace me with your SIGNING_KEY>"
```

And change its value to be the same that's set in your `backend/.env` `SIGNING_KEY`. Instructions
how to generate it can
be found in the backend/ documentation.
