```gherkin
Feature: show data in dashboard

  As a signed-in user
  I want to display the summed cash flows 
  in a pie chart 
  depending on a time window and seperated by category

  Background:
    And I am on the dashboard

  Scenario: show cash flow data depending on time slot
    Given I am signed in with email "EMAIL" and password "PASSWORD"
    And I am on the "dashboard" page
    When I select a specific time slot
    Then I click the save button
    Then I see a updated pie chart with different colors depending on the category and time slot


  Scenario: show cash flow data without selecting a time slot
    Given I am signed in with email "EMAIL" and password "PASSWORD"
    And I am on the "dashboard" page
    When I don't select any specific time slot
    Then I see a updated pie chart where the data is collected over the complete time
```
